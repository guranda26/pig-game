# Pig Game Project

This project was created as part of Udemy's **The Complete JavaScript Course 2024**. It demonstrates how to create a Pig game using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

## Game Rules

- The game is played with 2 players taking turns.
- Each player's turn continues until they choose to hold or roll a 1.
- Rolling a 1 resets their current score and passes the turn to the other player.
- Players can choose to hold to add their current score to their total score and pass the turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on the total score wins the game.

## Features

- **Roll Dice**: Roll a dice to accumulate points in the current score.
- **Hold Score**: Add the current score to the total score and pass the turn to the other player.
- **Reset Game**: Start a new game at any time.
